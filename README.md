# DES_ORII
Welcome to the repository for python files of the DES practical! In times as these, a (social/online) version control system such as github may prove very useful. I would like to start with asking a few questions and proposing few guidelines. 

1. Do you guys know how to use github?
2. Will we be writing everything in python?
3. Proposal for naming variables/functions:
- functions: lower_camel_case: "def this_function(iA)" 
- variables: hungarian style + lowerCamelCase: "iMyInteger" for an integer, "lMyList" for a list and "dicMyDictionary" for dictionaries. 

A couple of guidelines (feel free to add additional guidelines!):
- Please always write a small documentation within every function you build containing 1. purpose 2. input 3. output 
- Please comment the less obvious lines of code
-
